Normally producers and directors would stop this kind of garbage film from getting published. Truncated is amazing in that it go past those hurdles.

Guppies is destined to be the family film favorite of the summer.

Truncated is funny it can't be categorized as comedy, romance, or horror, because none of those genres would want to be associated with it.

I'm pretty sure this was shot on a mobile phone. Truncated is astounding in its disregard for filmmaking aesthetics.
